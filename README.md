### 🌙 Who I Actually Am (no filter)

2ⁿᵈ year Computer Engineering student trying to survive SPPU’s 2024 pattern while secretly enjoying the chaos  
I break things → panic for 0.2 sec → Google → fix → feel like a god → repeat  

I don’t know everything.  
But I’m stubborn enough to learn anything.

<br>

### 🧬 Current Obsessions (real-time)

```yaml
Learning:
  - Java OOP (finally understanding why inheritance isn't just free code)
  - Frontend → slowly walking towards Full-Stack
  - DSA (LeetCode hates me, but we're in a situationship)
  - Clean, intuitive UI that doesn't hurt to look at

Vibes:
  - Midnight coding + lo-fi
  - Figma wireframes at 3 AM
  - Turning "this is boring" into "wait, I can build this?"
